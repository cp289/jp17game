debugDavis()

A malevolent virus has infected Davis, bringing studentsâ€™ bugs to life! Play as a team of intrepid students to save the department and debug Davis. Explore first-floor Davis in lushly rendered 2-D form. Battle code bugs in RPG-style combat to save beleaguered CS students from their code-block. Level up characters and unlock new moves as you battle your way through the stages.
This game is played entirely through the keyboard. Please note that battles are not triggered when your character is in motion, and that you need to stand still every now and then to begin a debugging spree.

To start the game, cd to the top-level game directory and run:
