attackChooser.py
	make attack chooser more visually appealing
	reset cursor index to zero when switching to and from `share code' attack

script
	"my code is taking too long to compile" - in this context, it makes more sense
		to replace "compile" with "run" or "execute". Code with a bug would probably
		compile in the same amount of time or less time than the same program
		without bugs.

display
	screen shifts up after traveling up towards a wall and then moving downwards
	bottom 10 or so rows of pixels remain stationary in the hallway when moving side to
		side near the bottom of the screen
